# npcgen

This code's purpose is to create a set amount of NPCs based on the user's choice. Once the amount of NPCâ€™s is chosen. The code will then run the program over the number of times the user imputed and create that amount of NPCS requested. The NPCs have a name which is chosen randomly from a list of names in the code. The code also provides the NPC with a title that fits in with the theme of the fantasy world. The code runs through more attributes to make the NPC more fleshed out. This is all done with random integers. This code does not rely on anything more than just one input from the user. The code is quite repetitive with only having so many names and titles. But the more NPCs you print out the more varied the npcs get, at least that's what I observed. The attributes are VERY varied as the minimum and maximum of most of the attributes are very far from each other. The goal this code is to attain is giving a baseline of a character or NPC for any sort of fantasy game or just as a worldbuilding tool. There are different titles the NPCs can have that can range from simple beings to great monsters. At the end of all the Outputs the code does there is text at the bottom to describe more deeply what each attribute means to the NPC so the user has more of an understanding of what the NPC is.
